## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need to have [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) installed.

Once you've cloned the repository, you can install all the necessary development dependencies with a single command:

```shell
make install
```

This will create a virtual environment in `.venv` and install all the packages defined in `pyproject.toml`.

## Development

This project uses `ruff` for linting and formatting, and `basedpyright` for type checking. The recommended setup for VS Code is included in the `.vscode/settings.json` file.

You can run the linters and tests with the following commands:

```shell
# Run linting and formatting
make lint

# Run tests
make test
```

*This project was built from a streamlined version of
[simple-modern-uv](https://github.com/jlevy/simple-modern-uv).*
